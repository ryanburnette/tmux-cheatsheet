This is my [tmux]() cheatsheet with the most commonly used commands. I refer to
other cheatsheets often and those are linked at the bottom.

## Managing Sessions

### New Session

```bash
tmux new-session -s <name>
```

### List Sessions

```bash
tmux ls
```

### Attach Session

```bash
tmux attach-session -t <name>
```

### Kill Session

```bash
tmux kill-session -t myname
```

### Tab Completion

Note that tab completion works with tmux commands. When used in conjuction with zsh, it can make life easier.

## Commands
